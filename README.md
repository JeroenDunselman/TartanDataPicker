# TartanDataPicker
A test assignment for my favorite recruiter Karim, to showcase my iOS development skills for a very interesting potential employer. 
They asked me to show some dependency injection and testing while reporting on some data. 

There's no testing at all. Instead I have been wasting time solving other problems, probably caused by not developing test driven. Yet.
Sorry about that. I would be honoured to have another go if asked. (To see where I stand with testing please refer to the Impetus project in  github\jeroendunselman\impetus.)

The app reads data from a text file and tries to create and show tartan pictures (a pet subject). 
Working but not quite finished. Please refer to the Presentation branch.
